# Lab 06 â€“ Split Terraform Configuration into Multiple Files

## Goal

In this lab, you will refactor your configuration from **Lab 05** into separate `.tf` files for better structure, readability, and maintainability.  
Terraform automatically loads **all `.tf` files** in the same directory, regardless of their names or order.

---

## Suggested Folder Structure

```

lab06/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ provider.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ resource-group.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ storage-account.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ locals.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf
â”œâ”€â”€ outputs.tf
â””â”€â”€ terraform.tfvars

````

> ðŸ’¡ **Note:** The file order does not matter â€” Terraform automatically loads all `.tf` files in the working directory.
